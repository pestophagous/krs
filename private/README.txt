The `private/inputs/` directory contains files very similar to what is found in
the `inputs/` directory. However, in this `private` section the input files
are encrypted with git-crypt, because these practice problems are meant only
for the personal use of the repository's owner. Everyone else should refer to
`inputs/` for sample input files. And, of course, you are encouraged to make
your own input files!
